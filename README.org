* Invención
** Pending Tasks
*** TODO Tempi modifiers
*** DONE Sistematic use of \ritAtempoText and \acellAtempoTex
CLOSED: [2013-06-20 jue 00:42]
*** TODO Normalize tuplets
**** TODO Always use brackets
**** TODO correct straddling tuplets
Apply the solution provided by Alex, where the barline is erased near
the tuplet.
*** TODO Typography
Discuss on rational use of typography. ie: italics for techniques,
bold for tempi.
**** DONE Use Mint Spirit from [[http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/][Arkandis]]
CLOSED: [2013-06-20 jue 00:41]
*** TODO Harmonic pitches
Compare all the solutions for harmonic pitches (parenthezised) and
decide which one to keep.
*** TODO Remove numbers over whole measure rests
*** TODO Collate parts with reduction
**** TODO Check for double barlines in parts and reduction.
**** TODO Prepare a version with Lettered reharsal marks (from the reduction) and include sections like "CODA" and such.
*** TODO Rewrite measure counts in comments                      :Ezequiel:
Normalize and correct measure and system (staff) counts.
*** TODO Keep up to date with latest [[http://www.lilypond.org/development.html][stable devel]]
**** MAYBE Provide some script to convert between \times and \tuplet back and forth for those not wishing to upgrade
*** TODO Proofread parts                                    :Alex:Ezequiel:
**** TODO Pitches
Checking the latest version for correct notes against both reduction
and parts, especially where in the parts bars are broken over two
lines and it is unclear if accidentals pertain to the continued bar –
and making a decision in the cases of anomalies (I am not qualified to
do this)
**** TODO Bowing and dynamics
Identifying where bowing directions and dynamic markings are omitted
from the manuscript parts – rather often! I have taken to inserting
them when they appear clearly in the reduction even if not in the part
**** TODO Articulations
Sorting out confusion between articulations at places between the
reduction and parts.

*** TODO Page breaks
    Deciding on the most practical page breaks for the parts.

*** TODO Tremolos
Looking at the unbeamed tremolando stems and choosing whether or not
to extend them for clarity – I've been through all the beamed stems
already and made compensations where Lilypond has not quite managed.

*** TODO Reharsal Marks
Deciding where mark [A] might be – we start with mark [B] at the moment!
*** TODO Tempi and Spanners
Cleaning up some of the tempo indications and text spanners – a bit more LilyPond tweaking is needed here still.

*** TODO Tuplets
Amending some of the tuplet brackets (now in accordance with Paz's
part manuscripts) on those occasions where the music would flow
better.
**** Beaming
Improving the angle of some of the tuplet brackets and some of the
kneed beaming.

*** TODO Cues
Deciding whether additional cue lines in parts would be helpful to
players – Paz gives a few in the parts, but it might be kind to offer
a few more!

*** TODO Harmonics
Would the harmonic diamond note heads be easier to read if very
slightly larger and so more open?

*** TODO Positioning
**** TODO Dynamics
Raising some of the dynamic higher and before some notes that lie on
low ledger lines – similarly the other way with some bowing directions
over high notes

**** TODO Padding
Choosing or not to pad particular neighbouring bowing instructions if
it would give it a better impression when they are vertically aligned.

**** TODO Reharsal marks distance
Deciding what to do with some of the rehearsal marks which currently
look down from a great distance on the stave they belong to.

*** TODO Rythm
Correlating homorhythmic passges, where Paz may have notated them the
same in the reduction, but differently in the parts.

*** TODO Pitch
Considering enharmonic equivalents, where they differ in parts and
reduction

*** TODO /Code/
How best to present (or not) the alternative codas, and have separated
the parts out.
